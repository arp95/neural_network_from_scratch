### Introduction to the Project
A two-layer neural network for classifying cats vs non-cats. The neural network is built using numpy library where the image is flattened to form the input layer and the hidden layer has 14 neurons and the output layer has one neuron predicting whether the input image is a cat or a non-cat. 


### Results
The optimal performance was acheived using hyperparameters, learning rate = 0.003 and epochs = 7000. The results obtained using these hyperparameters is given below:<br><br>
Training Loss = 0.047<br>
Testing Accuracy = 76%


### Software Required
To run the .py files, use Python 3. Standard Python 3 libraries like numpy is used.
